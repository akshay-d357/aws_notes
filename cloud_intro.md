## **Q.** what is cloud? and what are the advantages of cloud?

**ans->** "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
In simple words we take resources on rent and we have to pay only for whatever we have used.
